# ROS-TurtleBot3-Robot-Simulation
TurtleBot is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software. TurtleBot was created at Willow Garage by MeloneeWise and Tully Foote .With TurtleBot, weâ€™ll be able to build a robot that can drive around a house, see in 3D, and have enough horsepower to create exciting applications.

## Downloading the TurtleBot3 simulation files:
Opening new  Terminal (Ctrl+alt+T)

Typing the following commands
```
~$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/

~$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git

~$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

## Installing the TurtleBot3 simulation packages:
Installing the independent packages for TurtleBot3 control by Entering the following commands:
```
 ~$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/

 ~$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git

 ~$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git

 ~$ cd ~/catkin_ws and type catkin_make
```

The preparation for TurtleBot3 is done.

## Launching turtlebot simulation:
TurtleBot3 has three models, Burger, Waffle, and Waffle Pi (as on the first picture), 
* specify which model will be used (e.g. Burger)
* choosing which file in gazebo folder to simulate (e.g. empty world)
* opening the file and replacing "TURTLEBOT3_MODEL" with "burger"
* close & save 

Writing the following commands
to  contact my own server without errors
```
~$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost

~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
```
the following commands to lunch the turtlebot simulation
```
~$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
```

Done successfully ))

## Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance:
Launching another Turtlebot simulation.

The simulation is to have TurtleBot3 autonomously navigate around a room and avoid crash into objects.
Typing the following commands:
```
~$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost

~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

~$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
 
```
On new terminal 
```
~$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch

```
